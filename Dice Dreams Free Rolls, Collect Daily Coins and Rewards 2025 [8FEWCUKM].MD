case with this game the further you get you can t get gold cards you need to finish sets the winter trail they ve come out with is virtually impossible to finish unless you pay for the game you can t trade in duplicate cards for card packs or dice and you can t unfriend someone in game those people you can t delete think it s funny to attack you numerous times because they ve got nothing better to do i only keep the game downloaded in hopes that things will change the developers of the game have made it clear via gameplay that this is a pay to play game if you want to advance further does it need to be so easy that you re finishing quests card sets and the trail on a daily basis no it just needs to be a little better with the longevity of some things and after 6 weeks of getting the exact same gold card give one every once in a while to finish a set that s why i think the trail is so long y all don t want anyone that doesn t pay to finish to get a guaranteed missing gold card i wouldn t download the game until it has better reviews and better in game play

i usually don t write reviews this might be the 3rd one i have ever wrote but i am writing in hopes that i can be heard and that some changes will take place is this game i have read the many reviews all the way from last year and it seems that i am having the same issues they spoke about the main issues that i have are not being able to add or delete friends in the app or in game please change this it s a complete hassle to have to go through facebook all the time also as you get to higher levels the prices skyrocket and the rolls and coins don t increase in comparison please change this also the side games are either to short or to difficult to complete without having to purchase coins or rolls and the trading cards i can never get the one gold card that i need and i have to wait until i can trade gold cards and then i have to go back and forth between facebook to do it i mean are you dizzy yet please find a different solution i really enjoy the game and i understand the challenge but i also know that when things are too challenging most people walk away and also people steal millions from me while i m in the game trying to earn enough coins to finish a building but when i steal from others i am only allowed up
